### API Management

* [API Management services should use a virtual network](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20Management/ApiManagement_VNETEnabled_Audit.json)  
  Azure Virtual Network deployment provides enhanced security, isolation and allows you to place your API Management service in a non-internet routable network that you control access to. These networks can then be connected to your on-premises networks using various VPN technologies, which enables access to your backend services within the network and/or on-premises. The developer portal and API gateway, can be configured to be accessible either from the Internet or only within the virtual network. 
  * Resource Types 
    * `Microsoft.ApiManagement/service` 
  * Policy Set Definitions (1)  
    * [Azure Security Benchmark v2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Regulatory%20Compliance/asb_v2.json)  

### API for FHIR

* [Azure API for FHIR should use a customer-managed key to encrypt data at rest](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20for%20FHIR/HealthcareAPIs_EnableByok_Audit.json)  
  Use a customer-managed key to control the encryption at rest of the data stored in Azure API for FHIR when this is a regulatory or compliance requirement. Customer-managed keys also deliver double encryption by adding a second layer of encryption on top of the default one done with service-managed keys. 
  * Resource Types 
    * `Microsoft.HealthcareApis/services` 
  * Policy Set Definitions (1)  
    * [CMMC Level 3](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Regulatory%20Compliance/CMMC_L3.json)  
* [Azure API for FHIR should use private link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20for%20FHIR/HealthcareAPIs_PrivateLink_Audit.json)  
  Azure API for FHIR should have at least one approved private endpoint connection. Clients in a virtual network can securely access resources that have private endpoint connections through private links. For more information, visit: https://aka.ms/fhir-privatelink. 
  * Resource Types 
    * `Microsoft.HealthcareApis/services` 
* [CORS should not allow every domain to access your API for FHIR](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/API%20for%20FHIR/HealthcareAPIs_RestrictCORSAccess_Audit.json)  
  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) should not allow all domains to access your API for FHIR. To protect your API for FHIR, remove access for all domains and explicitly define the domains allowed to connect. 
  * Resource Types 
    * `Microsoft.HealthcareApis/services` 
  * Policy Set Definitions (1)  
    * [CMMC Level 3](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Regulatory%20Compliance/CMMC_L3.json)  

### App Configuration

* [App Configuration should use a customer-managed key](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Configuration/CustomerManagedKey_Audit.json)  
  Customer-managed keys provide enhanced data protection by allowing you to manage your encryption keys. This is often required to meet compliance requirements. 
  * Resource Types 
    * `Microsoft.AppConfiguration/configurationStores` 
* [App Configuration should use private link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Configuration/PrivateLink_Audit.json)  
  Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your app configuration instances instead of the entire service, you'll also be protected against data leakage risks. Learn more at: https://aka.ms/appconfig/private-endpoint. 
  * Resource Types 
    * `Microsoft.AppConfiguration/configurationStores` 
  * Policy Set Definitions (2)  
    * [Azure Security Benchmark v2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Regulatory%20Compliance/asb_v2.json)  
    * [Azure Security Benchmark](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Security%20Center/AzureSecurityCenter.json)  

### App Platform

* [Audit Azure Spring Cloud instances where distributed tracing is not enabled](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Platform/Spring_DistributedTracing_Audit.json)  
  Distributed tracing tools in Azure Spring Cloud allow debugging and monitoring the complex interconnections between microservices in an application. Distributed tracing tools should be enabled and in a healthy state. 
  * Resource Types 
    * `Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring` 
* [Azure Spring Cloud should use network injection](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Platform/Spring_VNETEnabled_Audit.json)  
  Azure Spring Cloud instances should use virtual network injection for the following purposes: 1. Isolate Azure Spring Cloud from Internet. 2. Enable Azure Spring Cloud to interact with systems in either on premises data centers or Azure service in other virtual networks. 3. Empower customers to control inbound and outbound network communications for Azure Spring Cloud. 
  * Resource Types 
    * `Microsoft.AppPlatform/Spring` 
  * Policy Set Definitions (2)  
    * [Azure Security Benchmark v2](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Regulatory%20Compliance/asb_v2.json)  
    * [Azure Security Benchmark](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Security%20Center/AzureSecurityCenter.json)  

### App Service

* [API App should only be accessible over HTTPS](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/App%20Service/AppServiceApiApp_AuditHTTP_Audit.json)  
  Use of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer eavesdropping attacks.

* [Shared dashboards should not have markdown tiles with inline content](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Portal/SharedDashboardInlineContent_Deny.json)  
  Disallow creating a shared dashboard that has inline content in markdown tiles and enforce that the content should be stored as a markdown file that's hosted online. If you use inline content in the markdown tile, you cannot manage encryption of the content. By configuring your own storage, you can encrypt, double encrypt and even bring your own keys. Enabling this policy restricts users to use 2020-09-01-preview or above version of shared dashboards REST API.

  To monitor for security vulnerabilities and threats, Azure Security Center collects data from your Azure virtual machines. Data is collected by the Log Analytics agent, formerly known as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA), which reads various security-related configurations and event logs from the machine and copies the data to your Log Analytics workspace for analysis. We recommend enabling auto provisioning to automatically deploy the agent to all supported Azure VMs and any new ones that are created.
