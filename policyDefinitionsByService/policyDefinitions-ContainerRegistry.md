# Azure Policy Definitions - Container Registry

* [Container registries should be encrypted with a customer-managed key](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_CMKEncryptionEnabled_Audit.json)  
  Use customer-managed keys to manage the encryption at rest of the contents of your registries. By default, the data is encrypted at rest with service-managed keys, but customer-managed keys are commonly required to meet regulatory compliance standards. Customer-managed keys enable the data to be encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key created and owned by you. You have full control and responsibility for the key lifecycle, including rotation and management. Learn more at https://aka.ms/acr/CMK.

* [Container registries should not allow unrestricted network access](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_NetworkRulesExist_Audit.json)  
  Azure container registries by default accept connections over the internet from hosts on any network. To protect your registries from potential threats, allow access from only specific public IP addresses or address ranges. If your registry doesn't have an IP/firewall rule or a configured virtual network, it will appear in the unhealthy resources. Learn more about Container Registry network rules here: https://aka.ms/acr/portal/public-network and here https://aka.ms/acr/vnet.

* [Container registries should use private link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Container%20Registry/ACR_PrivateEndpointEnabled_Audit.json)  
  Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network.By mapping private endpoints to your container registries instead of the entire service, you'll also be protected against data leakage risks.
