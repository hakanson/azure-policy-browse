# Azure Policy Definitions - Storage

* [Storage account public access should be disallowed](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/ASC_Storage_DisallowPublicBlobAccess_Audit.json)  
  Anonymous public read access to containers and blobs in Azure Storage is a convenient way to share data but might present security risks. To prevent data breaches caused by undesired anonymous access, Microsoft recommends preventing public access to a storage account unless your scenario requires it.

* [Storage accounts should be migrated to new Azure Resource Manager resources](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/Classic_AuditForClassicStorages_Audit.json)  
  Use new Azure Resource Manager for your storage accounts to provide security enhancements such as: stronger access control (RBAC), better auditing, Azure Resource Manager based deployment and governance, access to managed identities, access to key vault for secrets, Azure AD-based authentication and support for tags and resource groups for easier security management

* [Storage accounts should allow access from trusted Microsoft services](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageAccess_TrustedMicrosoftServices_Audit.json)  
  Some Microsoft services that interact with storage accounts operate from networks that can't be granted access through network rules. To help this type of service work as intended, allow the set of trusted Microsoft services to bypass the network rules. These services will then use strong authentication to access the storage account.

  Secure your storage account with greater flexibility using customer-managed keys. When you specify a customer-managed key, that key is used to protect and control access to the key that encrypts your data. Using customer-managed keys provides additional capabilities to control rotation of the key encryption key or cryptographically erase data.

* [Storage accounts should have infrastructure encryption](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageAccountInfrastructureEncryptionEnabled_Audit.json)  
  Enable infrastructure encryption for higher level of assurance that the data is secure. When infrastructure encryption is enabled, data in a storage account is encrypted twice.

* [Storage accounts should restrict network access using virtual network rules](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageAccountOnlyVnetRulesEnabled_Audit.json)  
  Protect your storage accounts from potential threats using virtual network rules as a preferred method instead of IP-based filtering. Disabling IP-based filtering prevents public IPs from accessing your storage accounts.

* [[Deprecated]: Require blob encryption for storage accounts](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/StorageBlobEncryption_Deny.json)  
  This policy ensures blob encryption for storage accounts is turned on. It only applies to Microsoft.Storage resource types, not other storage providers. This policy is deprecated because storage blob encryption is now enabled by default, and can no longer be disabled. 
  * Resource Types 
    * `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts` 
* [Secure transfer to storage accounts should be enabled](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Storage/Storage_AuditForHTTPSEnabled_Audit.json)  
  Audit requirement of Secure transfer in your storage account. Secure transfer is an option that forces your storage account to accept requests only from secure connections (HTTPS). Use of HTTPS ensures authentication between the server and the service and protects data in transit from network layer attacks such as man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, and session-hijacking
